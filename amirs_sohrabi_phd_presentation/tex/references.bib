  abstract = {In this paper, techniques for modeling induced strain actuation of
	beam-like components of intelligent structures are developed. Two
	analytical models and one numer ical model describing the detailed
	mechanics of induced strain actuators bonded to and embedded in one-dimensional
	structures are presented. The models illustrate the exten sion, bending,
	and localized shearing deformations induced. The range of parameters
	for which the simpler analytic models are valid is also established.
	The specific characteris tics of one type of induced strain actuator,
	piezoceramic materials, are discussed, and im plications for practical
	use of piezoceramic actuators are outlined. Experimental results
	are used to validate the beam actuation models presented.}

	to the case of large electric fields and small strain. These latter
	equations are specialized to the case of thin plates with completely
	electroded major surfaces, and it is shown that in this case the
	charge equation of electrostatics is satisfied trivially to lowest
	order. It is further shown that for the thin stress&#x2010;free polarized
	ferroelectric ceramic plate subject to large electric fields, the
	resulting equations readily account for experimental data in existence
	in the literature}
